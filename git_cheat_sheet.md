## ðŸ’» Setting Up Your Local Repository

### Option A: Start fresh locally and push to GitHub

```bash
# In your project folder
git init

# Add files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Link your local repo to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git

# Set the main branch and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

ðŸ”„ Switching Between Multiple Repositories Locally

Suppose you have multiple projects/repos on your machine.

1. Navigate between repos by changing directories:
# Move to project1 repo folder
cd ~/project1

# Check git status here
git status

# Move to project2 repo folder
cd ~/project2

git status


Each folder is an independent Git repo.

. Opening a repo from anywhere:

Open terminal (Git Bash, PowerShell, or WSL)

Use cd to jump to your repo folder path

Example:

cd ~/Documents/devops/cheatsheet

ðŸ”§ Tips for Working Across Multiple Repos

Keep repos organized in separate folders with clear names.

Use descriptive branch names when working on features.

Commit and push regularly to keep remotes up-to-date.

Use git pull often to stay in sync if collaborating.
